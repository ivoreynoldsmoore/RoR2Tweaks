#### Warbanner
* No longer creates warbanners when you level up.
* The warbanner that spawns then you start the teleporter event will drop in the centre of the teleporter and apply the buff while you are inside the teleporter zone.
* The buff now scales with the total number of warbanners held by the players.

#### Fuel Array
The Fuel Array can now be used without killing allies, and more effective as a weapon.
* No longer deals damage to allies.
* The damage can proc item effects.

#### REX's Drill
The cooldown has been reduced so that the ability has a greater up-time.
* The cooldown has been reduced from 6 seconds to 4 seconds.

#### Commando's Grenade
The grenade's movement has been made more predictable, so that it is easier to use.
* The velocity of the projectile has been reduced.
* The mass of the projectile has been increased.

#### Commando's Tactical Dive
Commando is invulnerable during the roll.

This project was completed before it was made into a repository, which is why is has so few commits.
